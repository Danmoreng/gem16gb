# gem16gb

`gem16gb` is an early-stage C++20/CUDA inference engine for high-performance inference on NVIDIA GPUs with
approximately 16 GB of VRAM. The first model is the mixed FP8/NVFP4
`unsloth/gemma-4-12b-it-NVFP4` checkpoint, and the first optimized backend is Blackwell SM120/SM120a.

## What works

- The model repository is pinned to commit `b1f649734b34aa5575b03d186abd1b9be3d0d5c4`, including file sizes,
  SHA-256 digests, Git object IDs, and Xet/LFS identities.
- `gem16gb-inspect` memory-maps a single Safetensors file or indexed shards, validates offsets and byte lengths,
  parses the compressed-tensors quantization schema, classifies all 1,389 tensors in the pinned snapshot, and
  exports JSON.
- Host parser tests work on Linux and Windows without CUDA. Linux also has opt-in ASan/UBSan builds.
- `gem16gb-bench memory` builds an aligned, deterministic base arena from the real text-only tensor inventory and
  reports the required separate K/V cache plus the one-state diagnostic lower bound for every context profile.
- The exact host NVFP4 codec covers E2M1, E4M3FN, dynamic-local activation quantization, compressed-tensors global
  divisors, and a binary64 projection oracle with pinned-checkpoint byte fixtures.
- The CUDA build contains an explicit correctness-only W4A4 projection and an experimental direct-source SM120a
  projection. A complete real-checkpoint Layer-0 characterization now composes FP8 local attention and the NVFP4
  MLP without a host roundtrip or persistent weight repack. It is a correctness characterization, not yet a
  trusted-hidden-state or performance qualification.
- A CUDA-only, batch-one greedy characterization now loads the complete text model into one weight arena, executes
  all 48 layers with separate K/V caches, applies the tied BF16 output head and exact logit softcap, and selects the
  token on the GPU. The default applies the checkpoint's static E4M3 FP8 K/V scales; an explicit BF16 correctness
  mode remains available. Both modes run with zero fallbacks and no allocation in the token loop. Checkpoint EOS
  and suppressed-token controls are applied explicitly.
- `gem16gb-chat` is a pure C++ application. It loads the checkpoint's `tokenizer.json`, performs native
  byte-fallback BPE encode/decode, enforces the pinned `chat_template.jinja` contract, and sources EOS/suppressed
  tokens from `generation_config.json`.

Optimized prefill, contexts beyond the initial contiguous 1,024-token cache, sampling, CUDA Graphs, persistent chat
sessions, and benchmark-qualified inference do **not** work yet. The default cache now stores one physical E4M3FN
byte per K/V value and dequantizes with the checkpoint's per-layer BF16 scales during attention. It is still an
unfused correctness kernel rather than a performance result. The exact-blue greedy gate passes, while the longer
sky gate currently diverges from vLLM/llama.cpp at its third generated token. Unsupported modes fail visibly and
never fall back to a higher precision path.

## Build on Linux

CMake 3.28+, Ninja, and a C++20 compiler are required.

```bash
./scripts/build.sh --host --test
```

For the CUDA capability probe with the pinned local toolkit:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh --cuda --test
build/Linux/blackwell-release/bin/gem16gb-run --print-kernel-capabilities
```

The CUDA build targets only `120a`. Its experimental projection disassembles to
`OMMA.SF.16864.F32.E2M1.E2M1.UE4M3.4X`, but the capability report deliberately remains
`native_nvfp4_kernels=false` until real-shape, layer, logit, and benchmark gates pass.

## Greedy inference characterization

The first end-to-end path accepts token IDs so tokenizer behavior cannot hide model errors. It is deliberately
reported as `status=characterization` and `benchmark_qualified=false`:

```bash
build/Linux/blackwell-release/bin/gem16gb-run \
  --model models/checkpoints/unsloth-gemma-4-12b-it-NVFP4-b1f6497 \
  --input-token-ids 2,105,2364,107,40654,607,7121,506,3658,3730,236761,106,107,105,4368,107,100,45518,107,101 \
  --max-tokens 2 \
  --max-context 32 \
  --greedy
```

The checkpoint-declared FP8 K/V semantics are the default. Use `--kv-cache bf16` only for the explicitly labeled
BF16 correctness comparison. `--projection-path reference` selects the slow CUDA scalar projections; it is never
an automatic fallback.

Reproduce the committed-token gate without copying token IDs manually:

```bash
python3 tools/validate_inference.py \
  --run build/Linux/blackwell-release/bin/gem16gb-run \
  --model models/checkpoints/unsloth-gemma-4-12b-it-NVFP4-b1f6497
```

## Command-line chat characterization

Run the native C++ application directly:

```bash
build/Linux/blackwell-release/bin/gem16gb-chat \
  --model models/checkpoints/unsloth-gemma-4-12b-it-NVFP4-b1f6497
```

Enter `/quit` to exit. Add `--thinking` to enable the checkpoint template's thinking form. The current
characterization reloads the model and reprocesses the full conversation on every turn; persistent sessions follow
after the model-wide correctness gate. For an auditable one-turn result:

```bash
build/Linux/blackwell-release/bin/gem16gb-chat \
  --model models/checkpoints/unsloth-gemma-4-12b-it-NVFP4-b1f6497 \
  --message "Reply with exactly the word blue." --max-tokens 8 --max-context 64 --json
```

`--render-only --json` validates prompt rendering and token IDs without loading CUDA weights. No Python interpreter,
Transformers installation, server, or subprocess is involved in the chat application.

For prompt-derived layer diagnostics, add `--dump-state <file> --dump-state-position <position>`. The capture
preallocates pinned storage and writes only after generation. `tools/dump_vllm_states.py` emits the same
self-describing format from the pinned reference runtime, and `tools/compare_states.py` compares attention context,
layer intermediates, final hidden states, K, and V.

## Build on Windows

Use PowerShell from a regular terminal; the helper discovers Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with `vswhere`, imports
the x64 MSVC environment, and uses Ninja. CMake 3.28+, Ninja, and the Visual Studio C++ workload are required.

```powershell
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Test
```

For the CUDA capability probe, install the pinned CUDA toolkit. The helper uses `CUDA_PATH` when set and otherwise
discovers toolkits installed in NVIDIA's standard Windows location:

```powershell
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Cuda -Test
.\build\Windows\blackwell-release\bin\gem16gb-run.exe --print-kernel-capabilities
```

The target layout is the same on both operating systems, while CMake caches stay isolated under `build/Linux` and
`build/Windows`. The `host-sanitize` preset is Linux-only because it currently uses GCC/Clang ASan and UBSan.
The validated Windows development toolchain is recorded in `toolchains/windows-blackwell16gb.lock`; the Linux
reference remains in `toolchains/blackwell16gb.lock`.

## Download the pinned checkpoint

The checkpoint is about 9.34 GB. `HF_TOKEN` is optional for this public repository.

```bash
python3 tools/fetch_model.py \
  --destination models/checkpoints/unsloth-gemma-4-12b-it-NVFP4-b1f6497
```

On Windows, use `python` instead of `python3`; all Python tools use `pathlib` and accept native Windows paths.
The trusted vLLM reference runtime remains Linux-only because upstream vLLM has no supported native Windows
runtime; run those reference-generation and characterization commands on Linux rather than changing their
semantics.

The downloader resumes partial files, verifies sizes and SHA-256 digests, and never imports or executes code
from the model repository.

## Inspect

```bash
build/Linux/host-debug/bin/gem16gb-inspect \
  --model models/checkpoints/unsloth-gemma-4-12b-it-NVFP4-b1f6497 \
  --validate \
  --json manifest.json
```

The equivalent Windows command is:

```powershell
.\build\Windows\host-debug\bin\gem16gb-inspect.exe `
  --model .\models\checkpoints\unsloth-gemma-4-12b-it-NVFP4-b1f6497 `
  --validate `
  --json .\manifest.json
```

## Plan memory

Final K and V states require separate storage because their normalization and RoPE paths differ. Select it
explicitly; the JSON result retains the one-state byte count only as an audit lower bound:

```powershell
.\build\Windows\host-debug\bin\gem16gb-bench.exe memory `
  --model .\models\checkpoints\unsloth-gemma-4-12b-it-NVFP4-b1f6497 `
  --profile long `
  --kv-storage separate
```

The current base plan covers immutable text weights, scales, and KV payload. Activation, graph, sampling, kernel,
and prefill workspaces remain explicitly marked as unplanned rather than being estimated without an execution plan.

## Validate real-checkpoint layer assembly

After a Blackwell CUDA build, run all three real-checkpoint characterization gates with one cross-platform tool:

```powershell
python .\tools\validate_layer_checkpoint.py `
  --bench .\build\Windows\blackwell-release\bin\gem16gb-bench.exe `
  --model .\models\checkpoints\unsloth-gemma-4-12b-it-NVFP4-b1f6497 `
  --output .\build\Windows\blackwell-release\layer-checkpoint-validation.json
```

This executes Layer-0 local attention, Layer-5 full attention, and the complete Layer-0 decoder characterization.
It rejects fallbacks, persistent repacks, missing layer-scalar execution, host roundtrips between sublayers, and
divergent NVFP4 activation bytes. It deliberately does not invent a model-quality tolerance before the trusted
hidden-state distribution exists.

## Hardware and limitations

Blackwell is the first implementation target, not a permanent board-specific product boundary. Every benchmark
records the exact board, power, clocks, driver, and VRAM independently, while engine planning is expressed in terms
of the 16 GB CUDA hardware class. No engine performance claim exists yet.

Project code is Apache-2.0. Checkpoint use is governed separately by its model card and linked Gemma terms.
