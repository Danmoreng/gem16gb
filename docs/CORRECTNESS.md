# Correctness

## Implemented level

Level 0 currently covers bounded JSON parsing, duplicate-key rejection, little-endian Safetensors header lengths,
shape-product overflow, known dtype byte sizes, payload bounds, exact byte lengths, overlapping ranges, duplicate
tensors across shards, index agreement, UTF-8 strings, shard path traversal rejection, and symlink escape rejection.

`gem16gb-inspect --validate` additionally checks the expected primary architecture dimensions and quantization mode,
then requires each classified NVFP4 packed weight to have local, global, and input scale tensors.

An independent Python reader compares the raw Safetensors headers against the exported C++ manifest. For pinned
revision `b1f649734b34aa5575b03d186abd1b9be3d0d5c4`, all 1,389 tensors match across physical shape, dtype, absolute
offset, byte length, shard, and alignment; total tensor payload is 9,304,786,336 bytes with zero mismatches. The
validated decoder inventory contains 29 tensors in every sliding-attention layer and 27 in every full-attention
layer; full-attention layers omit separate `v_proj` weight and scale tensors.

Level 1 NVFP4 bring-up now includes a platform-independent E2M1 and E4M3FN codec, round-to-nearest-even host
encoding, dynamic-local activation quantization in groups of 16, compressed-tensors global-divisor application, and
a binary64 W4A4 projection oracle. Tests exhaustively round-trip all finite E4M3FN words and all E2M1 nibbles,
exercise rounding, saturation, and error behavior, and pin the first 16 packed values and first local scale from
layer 0 Gate row 0 of the locked checkpoint.

The CUDA correctness route independently uses CUDA 13.3 FP4/FP8 conversion types, matches the host packed
activation and scale bytes, and matches the host projection oracle. A separate experimental SM120a kernel consumes
the compact source weight and scale layouts directly. Its synthetic eight-row/64-K output and all three real
Layer-0 MLP projection shapes match the same oracle. The real Gate, Up, and Down maximum CUDA-reference/native
absolute differences were `1.1920929e-7`, `5.9604645e-8`, and `0`, respectively.

The first complete Layer-0 MLP characterization now executes input quantization, Gate and Up, Gemma GELU-tanh
product, Down-input quantization, Down, and residual addition without a host round trip. CPU/CUDA quantized input
bytes match exactly at both quantization boundaries. For its deterministic fixture the native and CUDA-reference
Down-input bytes and all 3,840 final float values also match exactly; eight final rows match the binary64 Down
oracle plus residual within `6.7374888e-9`. This remains a deterministic characterization, not a substitute for
the pinned hidden-state golden distribution.

Disassembly of the CUDA test binary contains `OMMA.SF.16864.F32.E2M1.E2M1.UE4M3.4X`. This is native-instruction and
real-shape evidence, but the kernel remains experimental until layer-golden, numerical-distribution, memory-arena,
and end-to-end gates pass.

Level 1 FP8 bring-up now includes host E4M3FN/BF16 decoding, dynamic per-token activation quantization, a binary64
per-channel-scale projection oracle, an independent CUDA scalar reference, and a direct-source SM120 tensor-core
route. The real Layer-0 Q `[4096,3840]`, K/V `[2048,3840]`, and O `[3840,4096]` shapes all produce bit-identical
CPU/CUDA activation bytes and scale bits. Across those fixtures the largest CUDA-reference/native absolute
difference is `8.9406967e-7`; the largest selected-row binary64/native difference is below `1.0e-7`.
Disassembly additionally contains `QMMA.16832.F32.E4M3.E4M3`. As with NVFP4, this proves the intended arithmetic
instruction and real storage mapping.

The first unfused local-attention checkpoint characterization now executes the real Layer-0 BF16 norm tensors and
FP8 Q/K/V/O tensor families through input RMSNorm, per-head Q/K normalization, scale-free V normalization, local
RoPE at position 31, K/V append/read, grouped-query causal attention over a deterministic 32-token cache, FP32
softmax, O projection, post-attention RMSNorm, and the residual update. The direct SM120 and independent CUDA scalar
projection routes produce a final 3,840-element maximum absolute difference of `4.8398972e-5`, RMS difference
`4.2503101e-6`, and cosine similarity `0.9999999999984577`. This validates operator composition and real tensor
binding without a persistent repack; it is not yet a trusted-runtime hidden-state golden or a performance result.

The corresponding full-attention characterization now executes the real Layer-5 tensor family with 16 query
heads, one 512-dimensional KV head, and proportional RoPE. It reuses the raw K projection as the V input because
the checkpoint has no `v_proj`, then deliberately diverges the states: K receives learned RMSNorm and proportional
RoPE over the first 25% of rotary frequencies, while V receives scale-free RMSNorm and no RoPE. Over the same
deterministic 32-token fixture, direct SM120 projections and the independent CUDA scalar route produce final
maximum absolute error `4.5299530e-6`, RMS error `5.5268314e-7`, and cosine similarity
`0.9999999999999085`. This also proves that `attention_k_eq_v` permits projection reuse but not shared physical
storage of the final K/V cache.

The complete Layer-0 decoder characterization now keeps the local-attention residual on device and continues
through pre-feedforward RMSNorm, dynamic NVFP4 input quantization, Gate/Up, GELU-tanh product, Down-input
quantization, Down, post-feedforward RMSNorm, the second residual update, and `layer_scalar`. It binds all real
Layer-0 FP8, NVFP4, BF16 norm, and scalar tensors directly from the checkpoint. The CUDA scalar-projection and
direct SM120 routes produce zero differing bytes at both NVFP4 activation boundaries. Their final 3,840-element
outputs have maximum absolute difference `4.7683716e-6`, RMS difference `2.8454761e-7`, and cosine similarity
`0.9999999999999643`. The probe owns 148,639,086 device bytes because it deliberately retains two complete
execution paths for comparison; this is not a production workspace or peak-VRAM estimate.

`tools/validate_layer_checkpoint.py` runs the local-attention, full-attention, and complete-decoder probes and
exports one combined JSON record. It enforces structural correctness gates but intentionally applies no model-wide
numeric tolerance. The next trusted fixture must use a real token sequence and contain the Layer-0 input, resulting
Layer-0 output, and matching K/V state needed to reproduce the selected decode position. The current deterministic
synthetic-cache characterization cannot honestly be compared directly with a prompt-derived hidden state.

The full-model greedy characterization now has precision-matched generation gates. For
`exact_blue_no_thinking`, the checkpoint tokenizer and exact `chat_template.jinja` produce the committed 20 prompt
IDs, and the engine matches vLLM's complete `[9503, 106]` response (`blue<turn|>`). The longer
`sky_sentence_no_thinking` case currently emits `[818, 7217, 7412]` with gem16gb's physical FP8 cache, while
FP8-vLLM and the compared llama.cpp run emit `[818, 7217, 563]`. Explicit BF16 vLLM and gem16gb both emit
`[818, 7217, 7412]`. This is deterministic greedy decoding, so the FP8 mismatch remains a blocking correctness
investigation rather than sampling variation. A previous working-tree revision matched the FP8 references at this
position, but only through compensating arithmetic errors that have since been corrected; that token match is not
valid current evidence.

`--dump-logits` captures every selected position as full-vocabulary raw little-endian float32 after preallocating
host storage, and `tools/compare_logits.py` compares it with the committed vLLM top-20 distributions. The earlier
BF16-engine versus auto-FP8-vLLM comparison placed token `563` at engine rank 2 and token `7412` at engine rank 1;
this was a real distribution difference, but it was caused by comparing different K/V modes rather than an argmax
tie or sampling randomness.

`--dump-state <file> --dump-state-position <position>` captures, for every decoder layer, attention context/output,
both normalized residual branches, Gate, Up, GELU product, MLP output, final hidden state, and newly appended K/V
inputs. Pinned host storage is allocated before inference and the self-describing version-5 file records projection
and K/V-cache modes, then is written only after the token loop. `tools/dump_vllm_states.py` disables vLLM frontend
multiprocessing for diagnostic hooks and emits the same format; `tools/compare_states.py` reports per-layer RMS,
maximum, cosine, and optional intra-layer metrics.

The state comparison exposed and fixed two concrete operator errors. vLLM rounds the tanh-GELU result to BF16
before multiplying it by the BF16 Up projection; gem16gb previously rounded only the product. vLLM's NVFP4
activation quantizer also uses `rcp.approx.ftz.f32` in both scale construction and normalization, rather than exact
division. The production CUDA quantizer now follows that arithmetic and a real vLLM boundary fixture pins its
packed E2M1 bytes and E4M3 scale.

After those fixes, prompt position zero is bit-identical to vLLM through Layers 0–29. The first remaining difference
is a small Layer-30 attention output difference (attention context is still exact); the discrepancy disappears
again after Layer 31 and the final captured Layer-47 hidden state is bit-identical. This is strong evidence for the
projection, norm, RoPE, residual, and MLP contracts at a single-token attention position.

The first cache reuse at prompt position one is now the earliest material mismatch. In Layer 0, gem16gb versus
FP8-vLLM attention context has RMS `3.846e-3`, maximum `6.25e-2`, and cosine `0.9999921`; the current V input is
bit-identical and K differs only by RMS `1.249e-4`. By generated position 24 the Layer-0 attention-context
difference reaches RMS `6.640e-3`, maximum `1.875e-1`, and then propagates through the model. The physical vLLM
cache was verified as `torch.uint8` E4M3 storage with layout `[blocks, 2, 16, 8, 256]`. The remaining work is
therefore narrowed to FP8 attention/cache-write arithmetic and attention reduction order, not tokenizer,
sampling, or the corrected NVFP4 MLP contract.

The native C++ tokenizer/template path reproduces all three committed reference prompt-ID sequences exactly:
20 tokens for exact-blue, 23 for the sky sentence, and 27 for the thinking arithmetic prompt. The application reads
the actual template file and accepts only the pinned supported revision. Its renderer currently supports
system/developer, user, and assistant text roles; tool calls and multimodal content fail visibly until their native
template branches are implemented. A separate German/Unicode probe containing umlauts, `ß`, and an emoji also
matches the Transformers tokenizer exactly across all 27 prompt IDs.

The patched same-source llama.cpp candidate supplies an independent comparison despite mapping FP8 attention
weights to BF16. It matches 50/65 reference output tokens overall: exact-blue is 2/2, the sky answer matches vLLM's
first 18 tokens before diverging, and the thinking trace matches 28/32. At the current first gem16gb sky
divergence, llama.cpp and FP8-vLLM both select token `563`, while gem16gb selects `7412`. This makes the remaining
attention discrepancy important even though later cross-engine differences still require distribution and quality
analysis rather than automatic acceptance or rejection.

## Not yet established

Broad projection distributions, accepted layer tolerances, full-vocabulary reference logits, broad cross-engine
generation agreement, and task quality have not been measured. Prompt-derived hidden/KV comparison is now
implemented for selected positions, but no tolerance has yet been accepted. Therefore `tests/tolerances.yaml` is
intentionally empty. The committed vLLM
fixture provides greedy token IDs and top-20 log probabilities, but it is not a substitute for full-logit Level 3
metrics. Tolerances will be added only after reference distributions exist.

## Direct reference runtime

The checkpoint model card's reference recipe is used in a separate, ignored Python 3.13 environment. The first
validated environment contains vLLM 0.25.1, PyTorch 2.11.0+cu130, Transformers 5.14.1, compressed-tensors 0.17.0,
FlashInfer 0.6.13, and NVIDIA CUTLASS DSL 4.5.2. `tools/generate_golden.py` runs the locked local checkpoint with
network access disabled, batch one, an 8K context limit, eager execution, no prefix cache, no CPU offload, and all
multimodal limits set to zero. Model-supported chunked prefill remains enabled. It records exact templated prompt
IDs, greedy output IDs, and the top 20 log
probabilities at every generated position.

Reference-runtime startup logs are part of the evidence: vLLM must select `CutlassFP8ScaledMMLinearKernel` for the
attention projections and `FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel` for the NVFP4 MLPs. Package selection alone does not
replace later per-kernel profiling.

The checkpoint declares a static tensor-wise FP8 K/V scheme and stores BF16 `k_scale`/`v_scale` values for every
layer. With `kv_cache_dtype=auto`, vLLM resolves this declaration to FP8. Reference commands that intend to compare
the engine's `--kv-cache bf16` mode must therefore pass `kv_cache_dtype=bfloat16` explicitly; otherwise the result
is not a precision-parity comparison.

Two consecutive runs on 2026-07-21 produced exactly identical prompt IDs, output IDs, and log probabilities. The
first engine initialization took 119.44 seconds while compiling and autotuning; the warm-cache initialization took
4.69 seconds. FlashInfer reported OOM for some autotuning tactics and stored default fallbacks for those shapes.
This does not invalidate the correctness fixture, but it disqualifies these runs as performance evidence and must
be revisited when configuring any vLLM speed baseline.

Run with the reference environment activated so its `ninja` executable is visible:
