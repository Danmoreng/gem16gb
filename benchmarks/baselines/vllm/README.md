# vLLM direct-checkpoint characterization

This is a development characterization of vLLM 0.25.1 loading the pinned
`unsloth/gemma-4-12b-it-NVFP4` checkpoint directly. It is not an accepted baseline or a gem16gb performance claim.

The run used batch one, BF16 KV cache, no CPU offload, token-ID input, no detokenization, no prefix cache, text-only
loading, chunked prefill, greedy decoding, CUDA Graphs, three warmups, and ten measured repetitions. vLLM selected
`CutlassFP8ScaledMMLinearKernel` for FP8 attention projections and `FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel` for the
NVFP4 MLP. The full configuration and every sample are retained in `direct-bf16-kv-characterization.json`.

## Comparison with llama.cpp

The llama.cpp candidate is the patched same-source closest-parity GGUF characterized in
`../llama_cpp/characterization.json`. Its MLP remains NVFP4, but its FP8 attention weights were converted to BF16.
Both runs used BF16 KV and batch one on the same machine. These format and timing-boundary differences prevent an
exact parity or headline speedup claim.

| Workload | vLLM median | llama.cpp median | vLLM / llama.cpp |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Prefill 128 | 4,679 tok/s | 2,215 tok/s | 2.11x |

| Decode at context 128 | 37.06 tok/s | 29.67 tok/s | 1.25x |
| Decode at context 2,048 | 35.98 tok/s | 28.87 tok/s | 1.25x |

For vLLM, prefill throughput is prompt tokens divided by its request-level time to first token, so it includes
scheduling and production of the first token. llama.cpp's `llama-bench` prompt-processing metric uses a narrower
boundary. vLLM decode throughput uses 256 intervals after one untimed first token; llama.cpp reports aggregate
generation throughput. The ratios are useful development indicators, not publication-grade speedups.

## Limitations observed

- The 512-token vLLM prefill point was noisy; all samples and its wide confidence interval are retained.
- FlashInfer autotuning encountered VRAM exhaustion for some tactics and used documented default fallbacks.
- The 8,192-token FP4 prefill shape was outside the tuned bucket range and used the default CUTLASS tactic.
- At 95% GPU-memory utilization, vLLM reported 10,303 BF16 KV-cache tokens. This supports the common comparison
  through 8K but not the required 32K/65K matrix. A later FP8-KV run must be labeled separately.
- Neither characterization captured power, clocks, thermals, profiler-level dispatch, or p95/p99 per-token latency.
- The llama.cpp candidate still lacks an adopted quality threshold and native-dispatch trace.
